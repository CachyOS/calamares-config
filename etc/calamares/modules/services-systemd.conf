# Systemd services manipulation.
#
# This module can enable services, timers and targets for systemd
# (if packaging doesn't already do that). It can also
# disable services and targets as well as mask units.
#
# The order of operations is fixed.  Enable services, enable targets,
# enable timers, disable services, disable targets and finally apply masks.
