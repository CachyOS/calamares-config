# Mount filesystems in the target (generally, before treating the

# Extra filesystems to mount. The key's value is a list of entries; each
# entry has five keys:
#   - device    The device node to mount
#   - fs (optional) The filesystem type to use
#   - mountPoint Where to mount the filesystem
#   - options (optional) An array of options to pass to mount
#   - efi (optional) A boolean that when true is only mounted for UEFI installs
#
# The device is not mounted if the mountPoint is unset or if the fs is
# set to unformatted.

# Btrfs subvolumes to create if root filesystem is on btrfs volume.
# If *mountpoint* is mounted already to another partition, it is ignored.
# Separate subvolume for swapfile is handled separately and automatically.
#
# It is possible to prevent subvolume creation -- this is likely only relevant
# for the root (/) subvolume -- by giving an empty string as a subvolume
# name. In this case no subvolume will be created.
